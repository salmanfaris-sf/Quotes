Never fear people. People cannot give you life or take it. When you only fear God, you become brave in front of everyone else.","Stop wasting time. Time is your life. If you waste your hours, you waste your years. Wake up early and start your work before the world wakes up.","Do not hurt others. Do not laugh at people to make them feel small. A strong man protects people, he does not mock them. Be kind but be firm.","Stay away from things that distract you. If a phone app or a bad habit stops your growth, delete it. A man of standards does not follow the crowd.","Keep your body and mind energetic. Move fast and work hard. A lazy body makes a lazy mind. Eat clean and stay strong so you can do great things.","Do not look at what others have. Focus on your own path. Your only goal is to be better than you were yesterday. Comparison is for the weak.","Be a man of your word. If you say you will do something, do it. Your name is only as good as your honesty. Never lie, even if the truth is hard.","Silence is power. Do not talk too much about your plans. Let your results speak for you. Work in the dark and let your success be the noise.","Stay away from bad talk and gossip. It is a waste of energy. Use your mind for big ideas, not for talking about other people's lives.","When life gets hard, do not complain. Complainers stay weak. Winners find a way to win. Thank God for the struggle, because it makes you iron.","Treat every day like a battle. You must win your morning to win your day. Discipline is choosing what you want most over what you want now.","The crowd is usually wrong. Do not do things just because everyone else is doing them. Stand alone if you have to, as long as you are right.","Focus on your purpose every single minute. If it does not make you better, stronger, or closer to God, it is not worth your time today.","Be soft with the good and hard against the bad. Use your power to help the weak. A true leader serves others but never bows to evil.","Sleep only when your work is done. Give your 100% to everything you touch. Success is not a dream, it is the result of focused work.","Never beg for attention. If they do not see your value, walk away. A man of standards knows when to leave. Self-respect is more important than being liked.","Your habits are your future. If you stay in bed and scroll your phone, you are building a cage. If you read and work, you are building an empire.","Do not be afraid of being alone. The most powerful people often walk by themselves. Use the quiet time to build your mind and plan your next move.","Control your anger. A man who loses his temper loses the battle. Stay calm, stay quiet, and let your brain think clearly while others are shouting.","Be the most hardworking person in the room. Talent is good, but hard work wins every time. Don't stop when you are tired, stop when you are done.","Clean your space and clean your mind. A man of standards keeps his world in order. Chaos in your room leads to chaos in your life. Fix it now.","Do not wait for the right feeling to start. Motivation is a lie. Discipline is doing the work even when you feel like quitting. Just do it.","Respect your elders and your parents. A man who has no respect for his roots will never grow high. Be a pillar of strength for your family.","Distance yourself from people who have no goals. Their laziness will rub off on you. Surround yourself with lions if you want to hunt like one.","Keep your goals secret. If you tell everyone, you lose the drive to do them.
