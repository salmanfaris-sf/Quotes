You must decide that being good is more important than being famous or rich. Most people are chasing things that will disappear, but you should chase the things that stay in the soul forever. It takes a lot of strength to be kind in a world that is often cold, but that is exactly why you were born with a heart.","We must be very careful with how we talk to others and how we treat those who are weaker than us. A single bad word can break a person's spirit for a long time, while a kind word can give them hope to keep living. True power is not about making others afraid of you; it is about making others feel safe when they are near you. Take a look at your own actions today and ask yourself if you are building up the world or tearing it down.","When you face a hard choice, always choose the path that keeps your character clean. It is better to lose everything and keep your honor than to win the world by doing something wrong. Your reputation is what people think of you, but your character is what you truly are when no one is looking. Do not follow the crowd if they are walking toward darkness. Be the one who carries a small light even if you have to walk all alone.","Discipline is the bridge between where you are now and where you want to be. If you cannot control your own body and your own mind, you will always be a slave to your desires. True freedom is the ability to do what is right even when it is difficult. Wake up every day with a plan to improve yourself, and do not let small distractions pull you away from your big goals. Your life is a gift that you must use with great care and respect."];const _0x4=["Try to spend some time in silence today so you can hear the truth about your life. We are surrounded by so much noise that we often forget what our own heart sounds like. When you are quiet, you can see your mistakes more clearly and find the strength to fix them. Silence teaches us that we do not need to explain ourselves to everyone. It is a sign of wisdom to listen more than you speak and to think more than you act.","Make it a habit to help someone today without expecting anything back from them. This is the only way to keep your soul from becoming selfish and hard. When you give to others, you are actually giving to yourself because kindness makes your own life feel full and bright. It does not have to be a big thing; even a smile or a helpful hand can change a person's entire day. Be the reason why someone believes that there is still goodness left in the world.","The food you eat and the things you watch have a big effect on how you think and feel. If you fill your body with bad things and your mind with bad thoughts, you will become a person full of anger and sadness. Choose to keep your body clean and your mind focused on what is pure and true. This is the secret to having a long and happy life. You must treat yourself with respect if you want others to respect you. Your health is a trust you must protect.","Always keep your promises, even if it costs you money or time. A person who does not keep their word is like a house without a foundation; they will fall when the first storm comes. When you say you will do something, let your actions prove that you meant it. This builds a wall of trust around you that no one can break. People will know you as someone they can count on, and that is a legacy that is worth more than gold or silver."];const _0x5=["Real courage is standing up for what is right even when everyone else is sitting down. It is easy to follow the rules when everyone is watching, but it is hard to do what is right when you are all by yourself. You must build a mind that is strong enough to resist the bad influences that are all around us. Do not let the world change your heart; instead, let your heart change the world by being an example of goodness and peace every single day.","Patience is not just waiting; it is how you behave while you are waiting. When things go wrong, do not complain or become angry. Instead, stay calm and look for a way to fix the problem with a clear head. Every trial you go through is like a fire that makes your character stronger and more pure. If you can stay patient during the hard times, you will surely reach the good times with a soul that is ready to enjoy them. This is the mark of a truly wise person.","Your friends are a mirror of who you are becoming. If you walk with wise people, you will become wise, but if you walk with the foolish, you will lose your way. Choose your companions carefully and look for those who remind you to be better. A true friend is someone who tells you the truth even when it hurts, because they want to see you succeed. Do not be afraid to be alone for a while if it means you can avoid being in bad company that leads to a dark end.","Success is not found in the things you own, but in the peace you find within yourself at the end of the day. You can have the biggest house in the city and still be very unhappy if your heart is full of greed and pride. Learn to be happy with what you have while you work for what you need. Simple living is a secret that many people forget, but it is the fastest way to find true joy. Be thankful for the small things like clean water, a safe bed, and a clear mind."];const _0x6=["When the sun goes down, take a moment to look back at your day and see where you could have been better. Do not be too hard on yourself, but do not be too easy either. Honesty with yourself is the only way to grow. If you hurt someone, try to make it right. If you wasted time, promise to be better tomorrow. A wise person learns from every hour and goes to sleep with a heart that is at peace with the world and its creator.","The way you treat your parents and your family is the true test of your character. It is easy to be nice to strangers who do not know your flaws, but it is hard to be kind to those you see every day. Show them the respect they deserve and be the one who brings peace to the home. A happy home is built on a foundation of love and patience. Do not let your outside success make you forget the people who were there for you at the beginning.","Your time is the most valuable thing you own. Once an hour is gone, it will never come back, not for all the money in the world. Do not waste it on idle talk or things that do not bring any benefit to your soul or your mind. Use your energy to build something that will last longer than you. Whether it is a good deed, a book of wisdom, or a strong family, make sure your life leaves a positive mark on the earth. This is the only real legacy.","Always remember that you are never truly alone and that your actions are always seen by the One who created you. This thought should give you comfort when you are doing right and it should make you stop when you are thinking of doing wrong. Live your life in a way that you never have to hide your face in shame. A clean conscience is the softest pillow you will ever sleep on. Walk on the earth with humility and grace, and the world will remember you with love."];function _0x7(){const n=new Date();const s=new Date(n.getFullYear(),0,0);return Math.floor((n-s)/864e5)}function _0x8(s){const x=Math.sin(s)*1e4;return x-Math.floor(x)}function _0x9(){const d=_0x7();const t=_0x1[Math.floor(_0x8(d)*_0x1.length)];const q=_0x2[Math.floor(_0x8(d+1)*_0x2.length)];const a=_0x3[Math.floor(_0x8(d+2)*_0x3.length)];const b=_0x4[Math.floor(_0x8(d+3)*_0x4.length)];const c=_0x5[Math.floor(_0x8(d+4)*_0x5.length)];const e=_0x6[Math.floor(_0x8(d+5)*_0x6.length)];const mt=t.toUpperCase()+".";document.getElementById("_p1").textContent=`PROTOCOL ${String(d).padStart(3,"0")}`;document.getElementById("_h1").innerHTML=`The <span class="text-white not-italic">${t}</span>`;document.getElementById("_q1").textContent=`"${q}"`;document.getElementById("_c1").innerHTML=`<div class="_r1"><p class="font-f1 text-5xl md:text-7xl leading-[1.1] text-eye _i1">${a}</p></div><div class="_r1"><p class="font-f1 text-5xl md:text-7xl leading-[1.1] text-eye">${b}</p></div><div class="py-20 text-center _r1"><h2 class="font-f1 text-7xl md:text-[10rem] italic _bg1">${mt}</h2></div><div class="_r1"><p class="font-f1 text-5xl md:text-7xl leading-[1.1] text-eye _i1">${c}</p></div><div class="_r1"><p class="font-f1 text-5xl md:text-7xl leading-[1.1] text-eye">${e}</p></div>`;_0x10()}function _0x10(){const o=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(i=>{if(i.isIntersecting)i.target.classList.add("_a1")})},{threshold:.1});document.querySelectorAll("._r1").forEach(l=>o.observe(l))}function _0x11(){const n=new Date();const m=n.toLocaleDateString("en-US",{month:"long"}).toUpperCase();const d=n.toLocaleDateString("en-US",{day:"2-digit"});const y=n.getFullYear();document.getElementById("_d1").textContent=`${m} ${d} / ${y}`}let _0x12=0;window.addEventListener("scroll",()=>{const v=document.getElementById("_v1");const c=window.pageYOffset;c>20?v.classList.add("_s1"):v.classList.remove("_s1");if(c>_0x12&&c>100)v.classList.add("_h1");else v.classList.remove("_h1");_0x12=c});window.onload=()=>{_0x11();_0x9()}})();</script></body></html>
